How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because I can compare both codes and allow me to easily see the
    differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because I can check what worked and what wasn't.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I can be sure when the changes are significative or logical.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    That multiple files commits are required to control all the project. It's
    important to know how the changes were made across the files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log is possible to check all the commits and diff allows to see
    all the differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    When I make changes I could destroy my working code, so I prefer to select
    some secure points and then change everything I want.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Actually, version control for all my projects.
